# 🧠 TabuQuest

**TabuQuest** is an AI-powered tabular data question-answering system. It allows users to ask natural language questions (e.g., *"Which product had the highest gross income in Mandalay?"*) and receive relevant answers from structured tabular data like CSV files. This system integrates a retriever + reader pipeline using **sentence-transformers** and **transformers (BERT-based)** to emulate how humans explore and query spreadsheets.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Accepts user queries in natural language  
- ✅ Uses sentence embeddings to locate relevant **rows and columns** in tables  
- ✅ Applies **transformer-based QA** (e.g., `distilBERT`) to generate accurate answers  
- ✅ Saves responses and context to an Excel output file  
- ✅ Easy to extend with more models or UI

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- `pandas`
- `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- `transformers` (`distilBERT`)
- `scikit-learn`, `torch`
- `openpyxl` (for Excel output)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User provides a tabular dataset (`input_table.csv`)**  
2. **User asks a question**, e.g.:
3. The system:
- Embeds the query
- Finds top relevant rows/columns using cosine similarity
- Extracts context and passes it into a QA model
4. **Answer is generated **
